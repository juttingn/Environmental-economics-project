consequences for economic output, deforestation and CO2 emissions. In \
the first scenario,  no policy is introduced for deforesting the \
Amazon and a discount rate of 6% is assumed, reflecting minor \
consideration for intergenerational equity. In the second scenario, \
we again assume no policy introduced for deforesting the Amazon but a \
discount rate of 2%, reflecting more consideration for \
intergenrational equity and what 'is believed to be closest to the \
rate a global social planner
would choose'. The third scenario introduces a policy that deters \
from deforestation completely (and assumes this can be enforced \
effectively) and also takes a discount rate of 2%.*)
